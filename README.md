# FlappyBirdAI
As the name suggests flappy bird game with ai included.
Run the code in FlappyBirdAI.js in p5.js editor available online.

If you want to play the game :
  in draw() simply change  ai.up /*mouseIsPressed*/   to   /*ai.up*/ mouseIsPressed   and the bird will fly on mouseClick.

In bird object push refers to upthrust and pull refers to gravity play around !

Ai works by calculating mid point of available escape space and adjusts its movements by considering effects of upthrust and gravity.
